In this document all analyses can be reviewed with full output. It starts by loading (and installing) the package with code that is used for the project and paper.

```{r}
if (!require(handlocs)) {
  if (!require(devtools)) {
    install.packages(devtools)
  }
  # options(download.file.method = "libcurl")
  devtools::install_github('thartbm/handlocs', ref='main')
}
library(handlocs)
```

Now that the code is available, we can download the data from OSF.

```{r}

```
